Hello everyone. My name is Sergey, and today I will tell you about this pie chart.

The pie chart shows time spent on studying different subjects in 4th term in MIPT. The total value is 442 hours which is approximately 18 days.

The most time-consuming subject is Algorithms, which takes about one quarter of all time. Differential equations and databases take around 9 percent each. Algorithms is 100 times more time-demanding than Economics. English takes about same amount of time as Physics labs.
