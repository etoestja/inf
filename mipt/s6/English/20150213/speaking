Good morning everyone. My name is Sergey Volodin, and today I am going to speak about the Jiaozhou Bay Bridge. Firstly, I will tell you why is it outstanding and show you how it looks like, secondly I will tell you about its key features.

So, first of all, what's so amazing about this particular bridge? Its purpuse is to connect two sides of a bay. Because of that, the answer is the Jiaozhou bay bridge is the longest bridge (over the water), specifically, 26.7 kilometers long, which is almost a diameter of Moscow.

Here you can see middle part of it.

On this picture you can see that the bridge is so long that goes beyond the horizon.

Now, let's talk about its features. First of all, the bridge is located in China. Its cost is 1 billion Pound Sterling. The bridge is supported by around 5 thousand concrete piles. Its width is 35 meters and it has 6 lanes for cars in total. And the bridge is a part of bigger transport project in this area, which includes other bridges and undersea tunnels

Thank you for your attention!
