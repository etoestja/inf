Good morning everyone. My name is Sergey Volodin, and today I am going to speak about the Jiaozhou Bay Bridge. Firstly, I will tell you why is it outstanding and show you how it looks like, secondly I will show you where it is, and, finally, I will tell you about its key features.

So, first of all, what's so amazing about this particular bridge? The answer is the Jiaozhou bay bridge is the longest bridge (over the water), specifically, 26.7 kilometers long, which is almost a diameter of Moscow. Its purpuse is to connect two sides of a bay.

Here you can see middle part of it.

On this picture you can see that the bridge is so long that goes beyond the horizon.

Moving to the next point, the bridge is located in China.

Finally, let's talk about its features. Its cost is 1 billion Pound Sterling. The bridge is supported by around 5 thousand concrete piles. Its width is 35 meters and it has 6 lanes for cars in total. And the bridge is a part of bigger transport project in this area, which includes other bridges and undersea tunnels

Thank you for your attention!
