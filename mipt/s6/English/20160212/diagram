Good morning everyone. My name is Sergey Volodin and I'd like to tell you about Real GDP changes over time.

The graph shows comparison of several countries by Real Gross Domestic product per capita changes from 2005 to 2014. Initial 2005 values are taken as 100 and consequent numbers represent change of the GDP.

As you can see, this index was equal to 100 in all countries in 2005. In all of the countries GDP rose steadily until 2008. However, the increase in US was almost twice as much less than in UK. In 2008 all of the values plunged by almost 10 points of index, except for the Australia. Japan lost more poins than any other country. On the contrary, Australia lost only several points of index. After 2008 GDP in all of the countries increased gradually with slight fluctuations, except for the UK and Euro zone. By 2014 all of the countries gained same value of index as of before 2008. Australia  values have even increased by 5 points. However, in UK and Euro zone situation is different. UK values fluctuated slightly until 2013 and then began to rise gradually reaching their highest level of 102 in 2014. Euro zone GDP also fluctuated with a small rise of 2 points.


To sum up, the graph shows a fluctuating increase with significant decline in 2008.
