\begin{document}
\maketitle
I think globalisation is a good thing. It makes scientific research and education faster, and some things such as mission to moon or cloning an animal become possible. It leads to technological growth, which is good also. And imagine situation: you have just arrived to some unfamiliar place, you are tired and it is 6 AM. You, probably, want to go some place to eat, and it better be well-known one. Globalisation helps you in this situation.
